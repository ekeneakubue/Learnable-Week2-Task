## Version Control 
As the name Version Control suggests, it is a system that records changes made to a file or a set of files. The system refers to the category of software tools that make it possible for the software team to look after the source code changes whenever needed. The system records all the made changes to a file so a specific version may be rolled if required in the future.

The responsibility of the Version control system is to keep all the team members on the same page. It makes sure that everyone on the team is working on the latest version of the file and, most importantly, makes sure that all these people can work simultaneously on the same project.

## Difference Between Git and Github
Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.

## Difference Between Git Fetch and Git Pull
The key difference between git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. The git pull command does both.
